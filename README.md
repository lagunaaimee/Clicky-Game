# Clicky Horror Game

## Overview

This is a React memory game. The application structure is broken up into
components and component states, and responds to user events.

### Instructions

1. It was created using
   [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

2. It renders 12 images of Horror Film Posters to the screen. Each image
   listens for click events.

3. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is
   incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score
   should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. The top
   score that can be achieved is 12.

4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle
   themselves in a random order.

5. The user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, and the game restarts.
